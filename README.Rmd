[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/r-devel/glossary/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/r-devel/glossary/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this package is to manage a glossary for R translation projects. The idea is based on [a proposal](https://github.com/SaranjeetKaur/isc_proposal_translations) created by [Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal (@SaranjeetKaur)](https://github.com/SaranjeetKaur/). The project was launched during the [R Dev Day @ RSE Con25](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/news/r-dev-day-rsecon25). This is repo is currently Work in Progress.

## Installation

You can install the development version of glossary from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("r-devel/glossary")
```

## Using pre-commit when contributing

This repository uses pre-commit. To install and run the it, follow the steps below:

- In an external terminal run `pip3 install pre-commit --user` (for Windows) or `brew install pre-commit` (for macOS).
- Based on the level of permissions you have, either directly clone this repository or clone a fork of this repository to a local directory.

``` zsh
git clone https://github.com/r-devel/glossary (or git clone https://github.com/USER_NAME/glossary, if it is your fork of the repo)
cd glossary
```

- Install the {devtools} and {precommit} package.
 
``` r
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("precommit")
```

- Run `precommit::use_precommit()` in the console.
- Once precommit is installed, each time you run `git commit`, the precommit hooks will run automatically. If any of the checks fail, you will need to fix the issues before you can successfully commit your changes.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
