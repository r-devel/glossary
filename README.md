# About this project

The aim of this package is to manage a glossary for R translation
projects. The idea is based on [a
proposal](https://github.com/SaranjeetKaur/isc_proposal_translations)
created by Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal (@SaranjeetKaur). The project was
launched during the [R Dev Day @ RSE
Con25](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/news/r-dev-day-rsecon25).
